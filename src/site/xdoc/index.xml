		<section name="ESIGate (Website Assembling Toolkit)">
			<p>
				ESIGate (formerly known as "Website Assembling Toolkit") is a
				toolkit developed to help developers to integrate
				existing web
				applications and aggregate them as
				a single website.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>ESI reverse proxy</b>
					: speed up your website using standard or custom (enhanced) ESI
					syntax.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>CMS integration</b>
					: include dynamic content from any CMS or website in your
					application easily.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Remote templating</b>
					: use a remote template instead of embedded files and be able to
					completely change design (not only CSS) on the fly.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>All together</b>
					: combine and assemble multiple applications into a single, fast,
					modular and standard-compliant one.
				</li>
				<li>Can be used stand-alone with any application or embedded in Java
					applications (JSP, JSF, Wicket and API support))
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section name="Reverse proxy and ESI processor">
			<p>
				ESIGate can be used as a reverse proxy.
				Proxied pages can parsed in
				order
				to process inclusion instructions
				that the applications insert.
			</p>
			<p>
				ESIGate fully support <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/esi-lang">Edge Side Include specification 1.0</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				ESI enables to retrieve fragments of contents and use pages
				as templates from an application to another. You can also
				retrieve fragments from xpath expressions and apply xslt
				transformations.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Taglib">
			<p>
				ESIGate offers a taglib that can be used in
				any JSP-based java web
				application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Basically, the taglib looks like Tiles
				tag library except that it
				enables you to include contents and use
				templates coming from
				other
				applications that may have been written
				using any technology and
				deployed on other
				servers.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Other uses">
			<p>
				Any functionality used by the taglib or the reverse proxy can be
				used through a simple API.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="How it works">
			<p>
				<img src="overview.jpg" alt="Overview" />
				HTML pages are fetched from the provider server using regular HTTP
				requests.
				Pages are then parsed to find specific delimiters used to
				define the blocks.
				The blocks are then aggregated and sent to the
				browser as a single
				HTML page.
