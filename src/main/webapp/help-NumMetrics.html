    CCM counts the Cyclomatic Complexity of your whole project. This parameter 
    allows to define how many occurrences you would like to see in the report. 
    The occurrences with greatest Cyclomatic Complexity appear in the top of 
    the list. 
  </p>
  <p>
  	Then in case you define 5 as Number of metrics, it is going to 
    bring you the 5 highest Cyclomatic Complexity occurrences in the source 
    folder you specified. 
  </p>
  <p>
  	Default value is 30 (same as CCM Add In for VS).
