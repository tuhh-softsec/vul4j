<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In many application environments that deal with XML-formatted data, it is
useful to be able to process an XML document in an "event driven" manner,
where particular Java objects are created (or methods of existing objects
are invoked) when particular patterns of nested XML elements have been
recognized.  Developers familiar with the Simple API for XML Parsing (SAX)
approach to processing XML documents will recognize that the Digester provides
a higher level, more developer-friendly interface to SAX events, because most
of the details of navigating the XML element hierarchy are hidden -- allowing
the developer to focus on the processing to be performed.</p>

<p>In order to use a Digester, the following basic steps are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new instance of the
    <code>org.apache.commons.digester.Digester</code> class.  Previously
    created Digester instances may be safely reused, as long as you have
    completed any previously requested parse, and you do not try to utilize
    a particular Digester instance from more than one thread at a time.</li>
<li>Set any desired <a href="#doc.Properties">configuration properties</a>
    that will customize the operation of the Digester when you next initiate
    a parse operation.</li>
<li>Push any desired initial object(s) onto the Digester's
    <a href="#doc.Stack">object stack</a>.</li>
<li>Register all of the <a href="#doc.Patterns">element matching patterns</a>
    for which you wish to have <a href="#doc.Rules">processing rules</a>
    fired when this pattern is recognized in an input document.  You may
    register as many rules as you like for any particular pattern.  If there
    is more than one rule for a given pattern, the rules will be executed in
    the order that they were listed.</li>
<li>Call the <code>digester.parse()</code> method, passing a reference to the
    XML document to be parsed in one of a variety of forms.  See the
    <a href="Digester.html#parse(java.io.File)">Digester.parse()</a>
    documentation for details.  Note that you will need to be prepared to
    catch any <code>IOException</code> or <code>SAXException</code> that is
    thrown by the parser, or any runtime expression that is thrown by one of
    the processing rules.</li>
</ul>

<a name="doc.Properties"></a>
<h3>Digester Configuration Properties</h3>

<p>A <code>org.apache.commons.digester.Digester</code> instance contains several
configuration properties that can be used to customize its operation.  These
properties <strong>must</strong> be configured before you call one of the
<code>parse()</code> variants, in order for them to take effect on that
parse.</p>

<blockquote>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th width="15%">Property</th>
      <th width="85%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">debug</td>
      <td>An integer defining the amount of debugging output that will be
          written to <code>System.out()</code> as the parse progresses.  This
          is useful when tracking down where parsing problems are occurring.
          The default value of zero means no debugging output will be generated
          -- increasing values generally cause the generation of more verbose
          and detailed debugging information.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">validating</td>
      <td>A boolean that is set to <code>true</code> if you wish to validate
          the XML document against a Document Type Definition (DTD) that is
          specified in its <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration.  The default
          value of <code>false</code> requests a parse that only detects
          "well formed" XML documents, rather than "valid" ones.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the scalar properties defined above, you can also register
a local copy of a Document Type Definition (DTD) that is referenced in a
<code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration.  Such a registration tells the XML parser
that, whenever it encounters a <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration with the
specified public identifier, it should utilize the actual DTD content at the
registered system identifier (a URL), rather than the one in the
<code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration.</p>

<p>For example, the Struts framework controller servlet uses the following
registration in order to tell Struts to use a local copy of the DTD for the
Struts configuration file.  This allows usage of Struts in environments that
are not connected to the Internet, and speeds up processing even at Internet
connected sites (because it avoids the need to go across the network).</p>

<pre>
    digester.register
      ("-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Struts Configuration 1.0//EN",
       "/org/apache/struts/resources/struts-config_1_0.dtd");
</pre>

<p>As a side note, the system identifier used in this example is the path
that would be passed to <code>java.lang.ClassLoader.getResource()</code>
or <code>java.lang.ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()</code>.  The actual DTD
resource is loaded through the same class loader that loads all of the Struts
classes -- typically from the <code>struts.jar</code> file.</p>

<a name="doc.Stack"></a>
<h3>The Object Stack</h3>

<p>One very common use of <code>org.apache.commons.digester.Digester</code>
technology is to dynamically construct a tree of Java objects, whose internal
organization, as well as the details of property settings on these objects,
are configured based on the contents of the XML document.  In fact, the
primary reason that the Digester package was created (it was originally part
of Struts, and then moved to the Commons project because it was recognized
as being generally useful) was to facilitate the
way that the Struts controller servlet configures itself based on the contents
of your application's <code>struts-config.xml</code> file.</p>

<p>To facilitate this usage, the Digester exposes a stack that can be
manipulated by processing rules that are fired when element matching patterns
are satisfied.  The usual stack-related operations are made available,
including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Digester.html#clear()">clear()</a> - Clear the current contents
    of the object stack.</li>
<li><a href="Digester.html#peek()">peek()</a> - Return a reference to the top
    object on the stack, without removing it.</li>
<li><a href="Digester.html#pop()">pop()</a> - Remove the top object from the
    stack and return it.</li>
<li><a href="Digester.html#push(java.lang.Object)">push()</a> - Push a new
    object onto the top of the stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical design pattern, then, is to fire a rule that creates a new object
and pushes it on the stack when the beginning of a particular XML element is
encountered. The object will remain there while the nested content of this
element is processed, and it will be popped off when the end of the element
is encountered.  As we will see, the standard "object create" processing rule
supports exactly this functionalility in a very convenient way.</p>

<p>Several potential issues with this design pattern are addressed by other
features of the Digester functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How do I relate the objects being created to each other?</em> - The
    Digester supports standard processing rules that pass the top object on
    the stack as an argument to a named method on the next-to-top object on
    the stack (or vice versa).  This rule makes it easy to establish
    parent-child relationships between these objects.  One-to-one and
    one-to-many relationships are both easy to construct.</li>
<li><em>How do I retain a reference to the first object that was created?</em>
    As you review the description of what the "object create" processing rule
    does, it would appear that the first object you create (i.e. the object
    created by the outermost XML element you process) will disappear from the
    stack by the time that XML parsing is completed, because the end of the
    element would have been encountered.  To deal with this, the normal
    approach is to push a reference to some application global object onto the
    stack before the parse begins, and arrange that a parent-child
    relationship be created (by appropriate processing rules) between this
    manually pushed object and the one that is dynamically created.  In this
    way, the pushed object will retain a reference to the dynamically created
    object (and therefore all of its children) after the parse finishes.</li>
</ul>

<a name="doc.Patterns"></a>
<h3>Element Matching Patterns</h3>

<p>A primary feature of the <code>org.apache.commons.digester.Digester</code>
parser is that the Digester automatically navigates the element hierarchy of
the XML document you are parsing for you, without requiring any developer
attention to this process.  Instead, you focus on deciding what functions you
would like to have performed whenver a certain arrangement of nested elements
is encountered in the XML document being parsed.  The mechanism for specifying
such arrangements are called <em>element matching patterns</em>.

<p>A very simple element matching pattern is a simple string like "a".  This
pattern is matched whenever an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> top-level element is
encountered in the XML document, no matter how many times it occurs.  Note that
nested <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements will <strong>not</strong> match this
pattern -- we will describe means to support this kind of matching later.</li>

<p>The next step up in matching pattern complexity is "a/b".  This pattern will
be matched when a <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> element is found nested inside a
top-level <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element.  Again, this match can occur as many
times as desired, depending on the content of the XML document being parsed.
You can use multiple slashes to define a hierarchy of any desired depth that
will be matched appropriately.</p>

<p>For example, assume you have registered processing rules that match patterns
"a", "a/b", and "a/b/c".  For an input XML document with the following
contents, the indicated patterns will be matched when the corresponding element
is parsed:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;a&gt;         -- Matches pattern "a"
    &lt;b&gt;       -- Matches pattern "a/b"
      &lt;c/&gt;    -- Matches pattern "a/b/c"
      &lt;c/&gt;    -- Matches pattern "a/b/c"
    &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;       -- Matches pattern "a/b"
      &lt;c/&gt;    -- Matches pattern "a/b/c"
      &lt;c/&gt;    -- Matches pattern "a/b/c"
      &lt;c/&gt;    -- Matches pattern "a/b/c"
    &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to match a particular XML element, no matter how it is
nested (or not nested) in the XML document, by using the "*" wildcard character
in your matching pattern strings.  For example, an element matching pattern
of "*/a" will match an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element at any nesting position
within the document.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that, when a particular XML element is being parsed,
the pattern for more than one registered processing rule will be matched
(either because you registered more than one processing rule with the same
matching pattern, or because one more more exact pattern matches and wildcard
pattern matches are satisfied by the same element.  When this occurs, the
corresponding processing rules will all be fired, in the order that they were
initially registered with the Digester.</p>

<a name="doc.Rules"></a>
<h3>Processing Rules</h3>

<p>The <a href="#doc.Patterns">previous section</a> documented how you identify
<strong>when</strong> you wish to have certain actions take place.  The purpose
of processing rules is to define <strong>what</strong> should happen when the
patterns are matched.</p>

<p>Formally, a processing rule is a Java class that subclasses the
<a href="Rule.html">org.apache.commons.digester.Rule</a> interface.  Each Rule
implements one or more of the following event methods that are called at
well-defined times when the matching patterns corresponding to this rule
trigger it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Rule.html#begin(org.xml.sax.AttributeList)">begin()</a> -
    Called when the beginning of the matched XML element is encountered.  A
    data structure containing all of the attributes corresponding to this
    element are passed as well.</li>
<li><a href="Rule.html#body(java.lang.String)">body()</a> -
    Called when nested content (that is not itself XML elements) of the
    matched element is encountered.  Any leading or trailing whitespace will
    have been removed as part of the parsing process.</li>
<li><a href="Rule.html#end()">end()</a> - Called when the ending of the matched
    XML element is encountered.  If nested XML elements that matched other
    processing rules was included in the body of this element, the appropriate
    processing rules for the matched rules will have already been completed
    before this method is called.</li>
<li><a href="Rule.html#finish()">finish()</a> - Called when the parse has
    been completed, to give each rule a chance to clean up any temporary data
    they might have created and cached.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you are configuring your digester, you can call the
<code>addRule()</code> method to register a specific element matching pattern,
along with an instance of a <code>Rule</code> class that will have its event
handling methods called at the appropriate times, as described above.  This
mechanism allows you to create <code>Rule</code> implementation classes
dynamically, to implement any desired application specific functionality.</p>

<p>In addition, a set of processing rule implementation classes are provided,
which deal with many common programming scenarios.  These classes include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ObjectCreateRule.html">ObjectCreateRule</a> - When the
    <code>begin()</code> method is called, this rule instantiates a new
    instance of a specified Java class, and pushes it on the stack.  The
    class name to be used is defaulted according to a parameter passed to
    this rule's constructor, but can optionally be overridden by a classname
    passed via the specified attribute to the XML element being processed.
    When the <code>end()</code> method is called, the top object on the stack
    (presumably, the one we added in the <code>begin()</code> method) will
    be popped, and any reference to it (within the Digester) will be
    discarded.</li>
<li><a href="SetPropertiesRule.html">SetPropertiesRule</a> - When the
    <code>begin()</code> method is called, the digester uses the standard
    Java Reflection API to identify any JavaBeans property setter methods
    (on the object at the top of the digester's stack)
    who have property names that match the attributes specified on this XML
    element, and then call them individually, passing the corresponding
    attribute values.  A very common idiom is to define an object create
    rule, followed by a set properties rule, with the same element matching
    pattern.  This causes the creation of a new Java object, followed by
    "configuration" of that object's properties based on the attributes
    of the same XML element that created this object.</li>
<li><a href="SetPropertyRule.html">SetPropertyRule</a> - When the
    <code>begin()</code> method is called, the digester calls a specified
    property setter (where the property itself is named by an attribute)
    with a specified value (where the value is named by another attribute),
    on the object at the top of the digester's stack.
    This is useful when your XML file conforms to a particular DTD, and
    you wish to configure a particular property that does not have a
    corresponding attribute in the DTD.</li>
<li><a href="SetNextRule.html">SetNextRule</a> - When the
    <code>begin()</code> method is called, the digester analyzes the
    next-to-top element on the stack, looking for a property setter method
    for a specified property.  It then calls this method, passing the object
    at the top of the stack as an argument.  This rule is commonly used to
    establish one-to-many relationships between the two objects, with the
    method name commonly being something like "addChild".</li>
<li><a href="SetTopRule.html">SetTopRule</a> - When the
    <code>begin()</code> method is called, the digester analyzes the
    top element on the stack, looking for a property setter method for a
    specified property.  It then calls this method, passing the next-to-top
    object on the stack as an argument.  This rule would be used as an
    alternative to a SetNextRule, with a typical method name "setParent",
    if the API supported by your object classes prefers this approach.</li>
<li><a href="CallMethodRule.html">CallMethodRule</a> - This rule sets up a
    method call to a named method of the top object on the digester's stack,
    which will actually take place when the <code>end()</code> method is
    called.  You configure this rule by specifying the name of the method
    to be called, the number of arguments it takes, and (optionally) the
    Java class name(s) defining the type(s) of the method's arguments.
    The actual parameter values, if any, will typically be accumulated from
    the body content of nested elements within the element that triggered
    this rule, using the CallParamRule discussed next.</li>
<li><a href="CallParamRule.html">CallParamRule</a> - This rule identifies
    the source of a particular numbered (zero-relative) parameter for a
    CallMethodRule within which we are nested.  You can specify that the
    parameter value be taken from a particular named attribute, or from the
    nested body content of this element.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can create instances of the standard <code>Rule</code> classes and
register them by calling <code>digester.addRule()</code>, as described above.
However, because their usage is so common, shorthand registration methods are
defined for each of the standard rules, directly on the <code>Digester</code>
class.  For example, the following code sequence:</p>
<pre>
    Rule rule = new SetNextRule(digester, "addChild",
                                "com.mycompany.mypackage.MyChildClass");
    digester.addRule("a/b/c", rule);
</pre>
<p>can be replaced by:</p>
<pre>
    digester.addSetNext("a/b/c", "addChild",
                        "com.mycompany.mypackage.MyChildClass");
</pre>

<a name="doc.Usage"></a>
<h3>Usage Examples</h3>

<h5>Processing A Struts Configuration File</h5>

<p>As stated earlier, the primary reason that the
<code>Digester</code> package was created is because the
Struts controller servlet itself needed a robust, flexible, easy to extend
mechanism for processing the contents of the <code>struts-config.xml</code>
configuration that describes nearly every aspect of a Struts-based application.
Because of this, the controller servlet contains a comprehensive, real world,
example of how the Digester can be employed for this type of a use case.
See the <code>initDigester()</code> method of class
<code>org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet</code> for the code that creates
and configures the Digester to be used, and the <code>initMapping()</code>
method for where the parsing actually takes place.</p>

<p>(Struts binary and source distributions can be acquired at
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/</a>.)</p>

<p>The following discussion highlights a few of the matching patterns and
processing rules that are configured, to illustrate the use of some of the
Digester features.  First, let's look at how the Digester instance is
created and initialized:</p>
<pre>
    Digester digester = new Digester();
    digester.push(this);
    digester.setDebug(detail);
    digester.setValidating(true);
</pre>

<p>We see that a new Digester instance is created, and is configured to use
a validating parser.  Validation will occur against the struts-config_1_0.dtd
DTD that is included with Struts (as discussed earlier).  In order to provide
a means of tracking the configured objects, the controller servlet instance
itself will be added to the digester's stack.</p>

<pre>
    digester.addObjectCreate("struts-config/global-forwards/forward",
                             forwardClass, "className");
    digester.addSetProperties("struts-config/global-forwards/forward");
    digester.addSetNext("struts-config/global-forwards/forward",
                        "addForward",
                        "org.apache.struts.action.ActionForward");
    digester.addSetProperty
      ("struts-config/global-forwards/forward/set-property",
       "property", "value");
</pre>

<p>The rules created by these lines are used to process the global forward
declarations.  When a <code>&lt;forward&gt;</code> element is encountered,
the following actions take place:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new object instance is created -- the <code>ActionForward</code>
    instance that will represent this definition.  The Java class name
    defaults to that specified as an initialization parameter (which
    we have stored in the String variable <code>forwardClass</code>), but can
    be overridden by using the "className" attribute (if it is present in the
    XML element we are currently parsing).  The new <code>ActionForward</code>
    instance is pushed onto the stack.</li>
<li>The properties of the <code>ActionForward</code> instance (at the top of
    the stack) are configured based on the attributes of the
    <code>&lt;forward&gt;</code> element.</li>
<li>Nested occurrences of the <code>&lt;set-property&gt;</code> element
    cause calls to additional property setter methods to occur.  This is
    required only if you have provided a custom implementation of the
    <code>ActionForward</code> class with additional properties that are
    not included in the DTD.</li>
<li>The <code>addForward()</code> method of the next-to-top object on
    the stack (i.e. the controller servlet itself) will be called, passing
    the object at the top of the stack (i.e. the <code>ActionForward</code>
    instance) as an argument.  This causes the global forward to be
    registered, and as a result of this it will be remembered even after
    the stack is popped.</li>
<li>At the end of the <code>&lt;forward&gt;</code> element, the top element
    (i.e. the <code>ActionForward</code> instance) will be popped off the
    stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on, the digester is actually executed as follows:</p>
<pre>
    InputStream input =
      getServletContext().getResourceAsStream(config);
    ...
    try {
        digester.parse(input);
        input.close();
    } catch (SAXException e) {
        ... deal with the problem ...
    }
</pre>

<p>As a result of the call to <code>parse()</code>, all of the configuration
information that was defined in the <code>struts-config.xml</code> file is
now represented as collections of objects cached within the Struts controller
servlet, as well as being exposed as servlet context attributes.</p>

<h5>Parsing Body Text In XML Files</h5>

<p>The Digester module also allows you to process the nested body text in an
XML file, not just the elements and attributes that are encountered.  The
following example is based on an assumed need to parse the web application
deployment descriptor (<code>/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) for the current web
application, and record the configuration information for a particular
servlet.  To record this information, assume the existence of a bean class
with the following method signatures (among others):</p>
<pre>
  package com.mycompany;
  public class ServletBean {
    public void setServletName(String servletName);
    public void setServletClass(String servletClass);
    public void addInitParam(String name, String value);
  }
</pre>

<p>We are going to process the <code>web.xml</code> file that declares the
controller servlet in a typical Struts-based application (abridged for
brevity in this example):</p>
<pre>
  &lt;web-app&gt;
    ...
    &lt;servlet&gt;
      &lt;servlet-name&gt;action&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
      &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet&lt;servlet-class&gt;
      &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;application&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;org.apache.struts.example.ApplicationResources&lt;param-value&gt;
      &lt;/init-param&gt;
      &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;config&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml&lt;param-value&gt;
      &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;/servlet&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/web-app&gt;
</pre>

<p>Next, lets define some Digester processing rules for this input file:</p>
<pre>
  digester.addObjectCreate("web-app/servlet",
                           "com.mycompany.ServletBean");
  digester.addCallMethod("web-app/servlet/servlet-name", "setServletName", 0);
  digester.addCallMethod("web-app/servlet/servlet-class",
                         "setServletClass", 0);
  digester.addCallMethod("web-app/servlet/init-param",
                         "addInitParam", 2);
  digester.addCallParam("web-app/servlet/init-param/param-name", 0);
  digester.addCallParam("web-app/servlet/init-param/param-value", 1);
</pre>

<p>Now, as elements are parsed, the following processing occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lt;servlet&gt;</em> - A new <code>com.mycompany.ServletBean</code>
    object is created, and pushed on to the object stack.</li>
<li><em>&lt;servlet-name&gt;</em> - The <code>setServletName()</code> method
    of the top object on the stack (our <code>ServletBean</code>) is called,
    passing the body content of this element as a single parameter.</li>
<li><em>&lt;servlet-class&gt;</em> - The <code>setServletClass()</code> method
    of the top object on the stack (our <code>ServletBean</code>) is called,
    passing the body content of this element as a single parameter.</li>
<li><em>&lt;init-param&gt;</em> - A call to the <code>addInitParam</code>
    method of the top object on the stack (our <code>ServletBean</code>) is
    set up, but it is <strong>not</strong> called yet.  The call will be
    expecting two <code>String</code> parameters, which must be set up by
    subsequent call parameter rules.</li>
<li><em>&lt;param-name&gt;</em> - The body content of this element is assigned
    as the first (zero-relative) argument to the call we are setting up.</li>
<li><em>&lt;param-value&gt;</em> - The body content of this element is assigned
    as the second (zero-relative) argument to the call we are setting up.</li>
<li><em>&lt;/init-param&gt;</em> - The call to <code>addInitParam()</code>
    that we have set up is now executed, which will cause a new name-value
    combination to be recorded in our bean.</li>
<li><em>&lt;init-param&gt;</em> - The same set of processing rules are fired
    again, causing a second call to <code>addInitParam()</code> with the
    second parameter's name and value.</li>
<li><em>&lt;/servlet&gt;</em> - The element on the top of the object stack
    (which should be the <code>ServletBean</code> we pushed earlier) is
    popped off the object stack.</li>
