<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>
Like the reverse proxy servlet, the aggregator is implemented as a servlet.
In addition to reverse proxying the pages, it parses the HTML code to find include directives to process.
</p>
<h1>Other advantages</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The toolkit is deployed on a separate web application</li>
<li>Aggregated applications do not have any dependency on the toolkit, they just have to insert include directives in the pages</li>
<li>Include directives are not intrusive, they are html comments and do not have any impact on pages</li>
<li>Aggregated applications are not necessarily written in Java</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
Target applications configuration is achieved through the usual driver.properties file. See configuration chapter for more details. Eg for 2 applications:

<p>
The aggregator is a servlet that has to be configured in the web.xml file.

<h1>Syntax</h1>
<h2>Defining a block</h2>
<p>Use the "beginblock" and "endblock" directives with the name of the block.</p>
<img src="aggregator_block.jpg" />
<h2>Including a block</h2>
<p>Use the "includeblock" directives with the name of the provider, the page and the name of the block to retrieve. If no block name, the complete page is retrieved.</p>

<h2>Defining a template</h2>
<p>Use the "begintemplate" and "endtemplate" directives with the name of the template. Use the "beginparam" and "endparam" directives to delimit params (variable parts that can be replaced inside the template)</p>

<h2>Including a block</h2>
<p>Use the "includetemplate" directives with the name of the provider, the page and the name of the template to retrieve. If no template name, the complete page is retrieved.
Use directives "beginput" and "endput" to replace params inside the template.</p>
