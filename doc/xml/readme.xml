	<s2 title="XML Security Release">
		<p>The &packagenamelong; &packageversion; supports the
		<jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210">XML 1.0</jump> 
		recommendation and contains advanced parser functionality, such as 
        support for the W3C&apos;s 
		<jump href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema.html">XML 
        Schema recommendation version 1.0</jump>, 
		<jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2/">DOM Level 2 version 1.0</jump>, and 
		<jump href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/">SAX Version 2</jump>, 
		in addition to supporting the industry-standard 
		<jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-core.html">DOM Level 1</jump> and 
		<jump href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/SAX1/">SAX version 1</jump>
		APIs.</p>
        <p>
        Note that because some of the standards
		are still not complete, the stable API will definitely be 
		different from its current form in &packagename; &packageversion;. 
		This is your chance to give us 
		feedback on the features that are important to you, and let us know
		whether the APIs that we are providing are the right ones. Please 
		direct your feedback to the &packagename; mailing list.</p>
