		Imagine you have to write a java application (master) that must
		include
		a block coming from
		an existing application (povider).
		<section name="Download the Website Assembling Toolkit">
			<p>
				Download the last version from SourceForge site. Any library
				needed
				in included inside
				the distribution.
				Copy webassembletool.jar
				and the
				other libraries inside the WEB-INF/lib folder of
				your web
				application.
	</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Configure it">
			<p>
				The tool try to load its configuration file from the classpath.
				Copy
				the exemple file from
				folder
				test/master/WEB-INF/classes/net/webassembletool/driver.properties
				into
				your source folder
				in net/webassembletool/driver.properties.
				Change the
				"remoteUrlBase" parameter to the base address of your
				provider
				application.
	</p>
			<code>
				remoteUrlBase=http://localhost:8080/provider/
	</code>
		</section>
		<section name="Tag the block on the provider application">
			<p>
				The block has to be tagged using special HTML comments.
	</p>
			<img src="block.jpg" />
		</section>
		<section
			name="Retrieve the block inside a page of the master application
		">
			<p>
				If using JSP, you can use the tag library. If not, the tool can be
				used as well directly using java code.
	</p>
			<p>
				Suppose the block you want to include is inside a page
				http://localhost:8080/provider/mypage.php
	</p>
			<img src="includeblock.jpg" />
			<p>
				NOTE: do not forget to add the taglib declaration at the beging of
				the page.
	</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Handling resources">
			<p>
				The HTML code included may contain links to resources (images,
				css,
				scripts, links). In order to have this links
				work, there are two
				possibilities :
	</p>
			<ul>
				<li>addind a HTML &lt;base&gt; tag in the page : you can use the tage&lt;assemble:includeBase&gt;</li>
		<li>have the resources proxied by the reverse proxy servlet</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	</body>
