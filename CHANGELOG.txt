	Fixed bug 39200(API CHANGE)
		Refactored the way keyresolver works instead of calling canResolve/resolveX only resolveX is used  
		and if it returns null it means it cannot resolve.
	Minor Optimizations. 
		Lazy fields initialization, initialize with null and create the object only when needed
		Registered Class reorder, in several parts the library contains a list of workers
			that are asked if it can solve a problem. Now the one that said yes is move to the front
			wishing that the next time it also hits.
	API Change: Make Transform & TransformSpi reusable between threads.	
		remove setTransform(Transform t) method in TransformSpi and pass 
		the Transform object in enginePerformTransfor methods.

New in v1.3
	Init-Don't fail if a transformation don't have all of its dependecies.
		Remove XPath initialization from Init and do only when xpath is needed.

	Remove the Use of xalan or xerces class URI
	Removed the expandSystemId
	Changed from Vector<String> to List<Class>, so we don't need to use classForName everytime and used it just the first time.
	Removed PRNG,HexDump,Version, X509CertificateValidator
	Added an unsync buffer outputstream.
	Changed Symbol table to a more efficient and simple structure
	Fixed bug 34743 , Submitted by: Lee Coomber <lee.at.lshift.net>
	Minor speedups in b64, Halved the table lookups.
	Reduce Object creation during c14n, from one to level to one per c14n.
	Change all Vector to List(ArrayList), we don't need synchronization safety.
	*Refactor the way we handle c14n of nodesets:
	    Before this patch every transformation creates a set with the nodes that should
	    be outputed. Every set is obtaining visiting the whole dom tree every time,
	    and then do it other time at c14n time. So it does <number of transformations>+1
	    visitings, very slow and memory costly.
	    Now every transformation just return a NodeFilter that tells if the node is included or not.
	    So only one visiting is done.
	Unified http://www.w3.org/2002/06/xmldsig-filter2 and http://www.w3.org/2002/04/xmldsig-filter2 transformation implementations.
	Removed http://www.nue.et-inf.uni-siegen.de/~geuer-pollmann/#xpathFilter transformation
	Canonicalization tree travesing is not recursive. it gives better memory handling and performance.
	Fixed bug 33936, Submited by: Raymond Wong <rwong.at.ariba.com>
	Fixed bug 35919, Submited by: Luda <ludab.at.lanl.gov>
	out of the box j2se 1.5 ready(no adding xalan in the classpath or endorsed if no
	   xpath transformation is needed)

##############################################################################
# New in v1.0.3                                                   24. May 2002
##############################################################################

IMPORTANT:

 - The different classes do not call Init.init() any longer. This must be done 
   by YOU in your application. If you miss that, you'll get many 
   AlgorithmNotRegistered exceptions...

--------------------------------

Summary:
 
 - The software is faster. Especially canonicalization is between 
   factor 5--80 faster than the old one.
 
 - Some deprecated methods in the Canonicalizer are deleted.
 
 - We support Exclusive Canonicalization
 
 - We support the XPath Filter version 2.0 Draft.

--------------------------------

Optimizations and speed-up

 - canonicalization
   - inclusive c14n is now faster (factor between 5 and 80)
 - transforms
   - enveloped-signature is now faster (no XPath ops any more)
   - base64 is now faster (no XPath ops any more)
   - c14n is now faster (due to faster c14n algo)

--------------------------------

Signature package:

 - The XMLSignatureInput which is used for passing node sets and octet 
   streams into transforms and which is also the result of transforms
   uses a java.util.Set now instead of a NodeList for the internal
   representation of xpath node sets. This allows easier queries in the
   form: Is node N part of the node set. 
   
   The implication is that you can also pass a Set which contains the nodes
   to be canonicalized to the Canonicalizers using
   public byte[] canonicalizeXPathNodeSet(Set xpathNodeSet)

--------------------------------

Canonicalizer:

 - A bug (well, my understanding of c14n) is corrected regarding the
   canonicalization of node sets. That bug related to the xml:* 
   attributes. See xmldsig mailing list archive @ w3.org for details.

 - removed are the methods

   - public byte[] canonicalize(Node node)
   - public byte[] canonicalizeDocument(Document doc)
   - public byte[] canonicalizeSingleNode(Node rootNode)

     replaced by public byte[] canonicalizeSubtree(Node node)

   - public byte[] canonicalize(NodeList xpathNodeSet)

     replaced by public byte[] canonicalizeXPathNodeSet(NodeList xpathNodeSet)
   
   - public void setXPath(Object xpath)
   - public Object getXPath()
   - public String getXPathString()
   - public void setXPathNodeSet(NodeList nodeList)
   
     These are no longer in use. If you want to c14nize an xpath 
     node set, select it using CachedXPathAPI and then apply 
     canonicalizeXPathNodeSet to the node set. 
   
   - public void setRemoveNSAttrs(boolean remove)
   - public boolean getRemoveNSAttrs() 
   
     The c14nizers do not add any attributes (namespaces or xml:*)
     to the document, so these method make no sense.
     
 - The Canonicalizer now supports "Exclusive XML Canonicalization 
   Version 1.0" <http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xml-exc-c14n>, Rev 1.58.
   
   For that reason, the c14n methods allow an additional String parameter 
   for passing the inclusive namespaces.
   
   public byte[] canonicalizeSubtree(Node node, 
                                     String inclusiveNamespaces)
   public byte[] canonicalizeXPathNodeSet(NodeList xpathNodeSet, 
                                          String inclusiveNamespaces)
   
   Such a string looks e.g. like this 
   
     String inclusiveNamespaces = "ds xenc ex #default";
     
   For more on exclusive c14n, see the spec. If you pass this parameter to the
   regular (inclusive) c14nizer, you'll get a 
   CanonicalizationException("c14n.Canonicalizer.UnsupportedOperation")
   
--------------------------------

Transforms:
   
 - The exclusive c14n is also supported by the transform framework. 
   The parameter for the inclusive namespaces is the class
   org.apache.xml.security.transforms.params.InclusiveNamespaces
   
   If you want to make a Transform like this, do that:
   
   Document doc = ...;
   Transforms transforms = new Transforms(doc);
   InclusiveNamespaces incNS = new InclusiveNamespaces(doc, "ns2");
   transforms.addTransform(Transforms.TRANSFORM_C14N_EXCL_OMIT_COMMENTS,
                           incNS.getElement());
                           
 - The XPathContainer for the XPath transform is now moved from the
   org.apache.xml.security.c14n.helper package to 
   org.apache.xml.security.transforms.params.XPathContainer

 - The enveloped-signature transform is faster now. We don't do costly
   XPath operations but 'simple' DOM ops.

 - Base64 is faster (no XPath ops).

 - The TransformXPath2Filter is now supported by the package. It can be used by
   using the identifier Transforms.TRANSFORM_XPATH2FILTER in conjuction with the 
   XPath2FilterContainer for passing parameters. To know what xfilter2 is, see
   http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-xfilter2/ :

   Document doc = ...;
   Transforms transforms = new Transforms(doc);
   XPath2FilterContainer x2c = 
         // intersect
         XPath2FilterContainer.newInstanceIntersect(doc, "//a");
         // subtract
         XPath2FilterContainer.newInstanceSubtract(doc, "//a");
         // union
         XPath2FilterContainer.newInstanceUnion(doc, "//a");
   
   transforms.addTransform(Transforms.TRANSFORM_XPATH2FILTER,
                           x2c.getElement());
   
--------------------------------
