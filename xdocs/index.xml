<section name="The Digester Component">

<p>Many Jakarta projects read XML configuration files to provide initialization
of various Java objects within the system.  There are several ways of doing
this, and the <em>Digester</em> component was designed to provide a common
implementation that can be used in many different projects.</p>

<p>Basically, the <em>Digester</em> package lets you configure an XML -&gt;
Java object mapping module, which triggers certain actions called
<em>rules</em> whenever a particular pattern of nested XML elements is
recognized.  A rich set of predefined <em>rules</em> is available for your
use, or you can also create your own.  Advanced features of <em>Digester</em>
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to plug in your own pattern matching engine, if the standard one
    is not sufficient for your requirements.</li>
<li>Optional namespace-aware processing, so that you can define rules that
    are relevant only to a particular XML namespace.</li>
<li>Encapsulation of <em>Rules</em> into <em>RuleSets</em> that can be
    easily and conveniently reused in more than one application that requires
    the same type of processing.</li>
</ul>

<section name="Releases">
    <subsection name='Digester 1.8 Release (03 December 2006)'>
        <p>
Digester 1.8 is a minor bugfix and maintenance release. A few small features have been added.
New projects are encouraged to use this release of digester, but there is no urgency
for existing projects to upgrade; Digester 1.7 has proven to be a stable release. See
the release notes for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
The dependencies for Digester 1.8 are identical to the dependencies for Digester 1.7.
        </p>
        <p>
Digester has a dependency on
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections'>Commons Collections</a>.
The dependency can alternatively be satisfied by including the latest BeanUtils
releases (1.7 or above) (which includes the stable collections ArrayStack class
necessary).
        </p>
        <p>
The recommended dependency set for Digester 1.8 is:
        </p>
<table>
<tr>
<th colspan='3'>Recommended Dependency Set</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Digester</td>
<td>+Logging 1.1.x</td>
<td>+BeanUtils 1.7</td>
</tr>
</table>
        <p>
Other compatible dependency sets for Digester 1.8 can be summarized as follows:
        </p>
<table>
<tr>
<th colspan='4'>Compatible Dependency Sets</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Digester</td>
<td>+Logging 1.1.x</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Digester</td>
<td>+Logging 1.1.x</td>
<td>+BeanUtils 1.x</td>
<td>+Collections 3.x</td>
